- Return % should be formatted as red if < 0, and green if > 0 (indicating arrows are optional)
- Text should align to the left while numbers should align to the right of each column

#### Optional

- Explore how the table could be structured in order to group the portfolio by asset class type
- Handle loading / updating states
- Add an 'Actions' dropdown to each row, with 'Edit' & 'Delete' options
